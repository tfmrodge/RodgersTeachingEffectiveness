# Rodgers Teaching Evaluations
The evaluations for CIVL 562 are for a course where I was the course instructor and sole 
member of the teaching team. The evaluations for CHE 299 & 399 reflect the entire course in 
cases where I was a tutorial instructor, with the exception of "2021_Winter_CHE399 Tutorial A 
Feedback_Summary".
