And the chance to ask TAs questions also helps.","Sometimes TAs recommend/tell us to assume things that the professor/client state is incorrect. Make sure there are less inconsistencies between what the TAs expects from us versus the actual graders.","","Sometimes your tone can come off as you think groups are willfully ignorant. However, we're just confused since the course doesn't really teach us much and we know absolutely nothing about consultancy.","You were very nice and supportive throughout the semester. Thank you for your hard work"

","Some of the tutorial worksheets are easy to ignore because i am not too sure how well we understand the worksheets so maybe further explanation for these tasks would be helpful!","Maybe more polls would encourage participation (as it is easy for the students and also interactive) ","Tim is a great TA that is very patient with his students especially in online learning! One comment I might have is that Tim could maybe use more specific examples when he is teaching content, so that we have a better grasp of what we need to do.","I like the morning ice breaker activities you do! as its a fun way to get the class started especially at 9am!"
"2021/04/14 6:27:46 am GMT-7","Somewhat useful","Greatly improved","Very approachable","Fairly engaging","I like the concept of this tutorial where it's mostly working on projects with the group, centred around group activities that should be done in tutorial. It was extremely useful for a project based course and helped reduce stress levels. It was easier to learn the course concepts since we had a set time to work on the projects.","I felt like the tutorial activities were hit or miss. Some weeks the activities really guided the work we did and helped me to learn about the week's topic. But the activities like the team check in in week two didn't really help, that felt like it was to early to work through with the team.","I think you need to incentivize people turning their cameras on during large group activities to increase online tutorial participation. I think it's because we can sometimes feel like we're being watched with our webcams on so it's important to have people be comfortable to turn their cameras on and be engaged in the class.","I personally like Tim's instructional approach and felt it worked well with my learning style.","N/A"

Lack of participation was largely due to people not feeling the need to participate in an online setting. Maybe partitioning part of the grade to participation might encourage more participation in the virtual setting.","No.","My group and I constantly felt that we could approach Tim with assistance ranging from actual report writing and presenting to understanding the nature of these types of projects in the industry. Tim's knowledge regarding the course content was expansive and his ability to relate with his students while explaining it was very refreshing to see. Tim did a great job this semester!"

"2021/04/17 2:40:30 pm GMT-7","Somewhat useful","Greatly improved","Very approachable","Fairly engaging","It's nice that we had time to work on things independently and we had time to work on our own projects.","Put it later in the day (for attendance), some of the activities seemed like busy work. The overall scheduling of the tutorials was poor, it felt like the work that we had due was being introduced the week it was due; it would've been much easier if the lecture/course material was staggered from the tutorials by one week.","Put them later in the day, make them more useful overall (the TAs weren't very knowledgeable of the projects, it didn't make much of a difference if we went to tutorial or just worked on a group call without a TA).","No, overall he was a great TA.","Thank you for the amazing semester! Even though you weren't 100% knowledgable about the regulations, you gave us some amazing guidance for our sampling plan and the overall project."
